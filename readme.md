# Pank Keyboard
This keyboard is available under GPLv3, there is no warrenty, and no support or request will be provided. 
This is modified version of Pteron36 for people who wanted more agressive stagger, and bit more crampped thumb fan. 
I donot plan to test,sell, or build these for my self as Pteron36 is my end game.

Anyone who wants to use this keyboard files can do so as per GPLv3 guidance and limitation.
Do not ask for modificaitons, make a fork and do whatever you want. Just make sure to give due credit to original Pteron project, and Pteron36 project.

Be Kind, Be Awesome, dont bully anyone.
